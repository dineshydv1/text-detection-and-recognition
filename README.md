Model to detect and recognize text in images and videos

This repository contains code details of my capstone project undertaken as part of SpringBoard AI & Machine Learning program.

Capstone project I undertook is to build a model to detect and recognize text in images and videos. 

Project Description: Task is to identify text in an image or a video stream. Text can be hand written, printed or in any font. It can include numeric or alphabet characters. Image can be of a landscape, sign board, house number etc. Initially, roject is limited to english alphabets only.

I have used below approaches:

### Approach 1: EAST Algorithm with OpenCV: 


### Approach 2: YOLO Algorithm:
PENDING.
