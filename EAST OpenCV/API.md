## EAST Algorithm with OpenCV: 

I used flask to create user interface for project API. In homepage of interface, user can choose an image having some text which project should recognize and detect. 
When user click on submit, python script runs in backend. Script includes EAST algoritms and pytesseract. Script outputs text area bounding boxes and text within. This text is displayed on the user interface. 

To run the flask API, run script flaskApp.py
